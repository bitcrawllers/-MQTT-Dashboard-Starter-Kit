# Contributing to MQTT Dashboard Starter Kit

Welcome to the MQTT Dashboard Starter Kit.  
This is an open-source project aimed at experimenting with IoT dashboards.  

**Current Status:**  
- Frontend simulator implemented (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- No backend yet  
- No real MQTT broker connection  
- No device authentication or persistence  

**Goal:**  
To evolve this project into a full IoT connectivity framework with:  
1. Real MQTT broker integration via a backend (Flask/Node.js)  
2. Peer-to-peer device communication (WebRTC/libp2p)  
3. Edge AI features for intelligent automation

## Where You Can Contribute

### Backend Development (High Priority)
- Build a Flask or Node.js backend that connects to MQTT brokers (Mosquitto, HiveMQ, EMQX)  
- Expose REST API or WebSocket endpoints for the dashboard  
- Handle multiple device sessions, authentication, and data persistence  
- Prepare the system for future peer-to-peer experiments  

### Frontend Enhancements
- Improve UI/UX for real-time data  
- Add charts, device history, and alerts  
- Integrate frontend with the new backend APIs  

### Documentation
- Write clear setup guides for brokers and local testing  
- Provide onboarding instructions for new contributors  
- Add tutorials or example workflows  

### Research & Experiments
- Prototype peer-to-peer device connections  
- Explore Edge AI/ML features for IoT devices

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (Current):** Build backend system with MQTT broker integration  
- **Phase 2:** Add authentication, multi-device support, and real-time dashboard features  
- **Phase 3:** Implement peer-to-peer IoT connectivity  
- **Phase 4:** Integrate Edge AI features

## Good First Issues

- Setup a Flask backend scaffold  
- Create basic REST API endpoints to serve frontend data  
- Add WebSocket support for live updates  
- Write documentation for setting up a local MQTT broker  
- Improve frontend charts and logs for simulated data
